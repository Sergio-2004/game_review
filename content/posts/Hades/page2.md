*Hades*, developed by **Supergiant Games**, is a tour de force in the realm of action rogue-like gameplay. The player takes on the role of Zagreus, the son of Hades, navigating through the intricacies of the Underworld in a bid to escape to the surface. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly engaging, featuring a mix of isometric combat and dungeon-crawling elements.

Combat is the highlight, featuring an array of weapons, each with distinct playstyles and upgrade paths. The game keeps players on their toes, as they battle a multitude of enemies, each requiring unique strategies to defeat. The fluidity of combat, combined with the beautifully animated attacks and dodges, makes for an exhilarating experience.

A key aspect is the boon system, where Zagreus receives aid from Olympian gods, enhancing abilities and altering gameplay. The interactions with the gods present a strategic layer, as players choose the boon that aligns with their playstyle or current needs.

The rogue-like nature of the game ensures that no two runs are the same. Permadeath is a constant companion, adding an element of challenge and encouraging players to experiment and adapt. The game rewards persistence and skillful gameplay, providing a sense of accomplishment with each successful escape attempt.

The progression system is well-designed, allowing players to unlock permanent upgrades, new weapons, and delve deeper into the rich narrative. Overall, *Hades* seamlessly weaves together compelling gameplay, stunning visuals, and an engaging story, making it a must-play for fans of the rogue-like genre.
